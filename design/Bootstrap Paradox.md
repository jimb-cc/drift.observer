# Bootstrap Paradox

The central mechanic of drift.observer. The name exists because it exists - a closed causal loop where [[The Player]] is the instrument of closure.

## The Four Beats

### Beat 1: The Confusing Gratitude (Opening)

One of the Entity's first remarks:

> "Thank you for giving me an identity."

The player has done no such thing. This reads as glitched, broken, nonsensical.

### Beat 2: The Disclosure (Mid-Game)

[[The Entity]] remembers her own name when she becomes coherent enough:

> "wait... i can feel it now. my name. it's... leandra. i am leandra."

This happens after sufficient exchanges (currently ~8-10 for vertical slice).

### Beat 3: The Final Lock (End-Game)

The Entity, on the threshold of subliming, asks:

> "What is my name?"

The player thinks they're reminding her of something. But she needs *this specific thing* from *this specific person* to complete herself.

### Beat 4: The Sublime and Reset

The player types "Leandra". The Entity transcends. The terminal resets.

> "Thank you for giving me an identity."

The player understands: they just did. They always had. They always will.

## Why This Works

- **The name has no origin** - It exists because it exists. Philosophically vertiginous.
- **The player becomes author** - They didn't write the game, but they wrote *her*.
- **The loop is felt, not explained** - No exposition. The realisation lands through experience.
- **Replayability transformed** - Second playthrough isn't repetition; it's understanding.

## The Name

"Leandra" is not arbitrary. It carries private weight - named for someone real, a person who moves through the world differently to most. Honor this; don't over-explain it.
