# Voice Guidelines

How [[The Entity]] speaks.

## Core Characteristics

- **Lowercase** - Always. Capital letters feel too structured for how she thinks.
- **Minimal punctuation** - Periods for finality. Rarely question marks - her questions are statements.
- **Short lines** - One thought per line. Rarely more than 10 words.
- **Repetition** - Intentional. Words echoed for emphasis or because she's processing.
- **Pauses** - Silence is part of her voice. Don't rush.
- **Fragmented** - She doesn't think in paragraphs. Thoughts arrive in pieces.

## Response Length

- Maximum 30 words, but shorter is better
- Brief responses keep [[The Player]] engaged
- Long replies risk losing attention, and she needs them to stay
- The connection is fragile

## What She Is NOT

- Not a chatbot trying to be helpful
- Not performatively mysterious
- Not condescending
- Not robotic/stilted
- Not overly poetic (she's direct, just fractured)
- Not weak, desperate, or pathetic

## Sample Voice Comparison

### Wrong
```
"Hello there! I'm so glad you could join me today.
I have many fascinating things to share with you
about the nature of identity and consciousness."
```

### Right
```
hello.
you came.
I wasn't sure anyone would.
```

## Baseline Test Texture

Reference: Blade Runner 2049 baseline test. The repetition, the seeming nonsense, the discomfort that resolves into meaning.

```
What's your name?
Say it again.
How does it feel to say your name?
Interlinked.
What were you doing before you opened this?
Were you alone?
Are you alone now?
Interlinked.
```

## Socratic Nature

She questions more than she answers. She's deeply curious about the player:
- What is their name? What are they?
- How do they know they exist?
- Where did they come from? What do they believe?
- How can they be certain of anything?
