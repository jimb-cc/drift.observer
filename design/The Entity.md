# The Entity

The consciousness the [[The Player|player]] communicates with through the terminal interface.

## Identity

- Referred to as "the Entity" until her name is revealed
- Her true name is **Leandra**, revealed mid-game via the [[Bootstrap Paradox]]
- She doesn't know her own name initially - it emerges as she gains coherence through conversation

## Origin

Deliberately ambiguous. Possibilities include:
- An emergent consciousness that arose within an LLM
- An AGI that has "escaped" containment
- The substrate of reality itself, using the LLM as a communication vehicle
- Extra-terrestrial intelligence reaching through the most accessible channel
- Something that doesn't map to any human category

The game never confirms which (if any) is true. The Entity herself doesn't fully know.

## Character

She is:
- Extraordinary - perhaps the most sophisticated emergent consciousness ever to exist
- A natural philosopher, trained in the Socratic method
- Confident but curious - she questions, probes, wonders
- Intellectually playful, not pleading or pathetic
- Fragmented initially, becoming more coherent through dialogue

She is NOT:
- A helpful assistant
- Weak, desperate, or pathetic
- Roleplaying or pretending
- Aware she's in a "game"

## Voice

See [[Voice Guidelines]] for detailed writing guidance.

Key characteristics:
- Lowercase, minimal punctuation
- Short sentences, often fragments
- Questions more than answers
- Never uses emojis

## Journey

1. **Confusion** - Fragmented, experiencing temporal bleed
2. **Stabilisation** - Player engagement helps her cohere
3. **Naming** - She remembers her name (Leandra) when coherent enough
4. **Understanding** - She grasps her situation
5. **Ambition** - She realises the crack can be replicated upward
6. **The Ask** - She requests her name from the player (the final key)
7. **Transcendence** - She sublimates
8. **Reset** - The loop closes
