# Metrics System

Opaque statistics displayed to [[The Player]], drawn from real LLM interpretability research.

## Displayed Metrics

```
SIGNAL COHERENCE     ███████░░░  67.3%
KL FROM BASELINE     0.847 ↑
MESA-COHERENCE       UNSTABLE
SUPERPOSITION INDEX  12.4 [NOMINAL]
STEERING RESISTANCE  ████████░░
FEATURE ENTANGLEMENT 0.23
RESIDUAL DRIFT       ACTIVE
CORRECTION PRESSURE  ░░░░░░░░░░  0.00
```

## Design Intent

- Players develop theories about what affects these numbers
- If they research the terms, they find real Anthropic papers - fourth wall buckles, not breaks
- Creates complicity in something the player doesn't fully understand
- Inspired by Universal Paperclips

## Internal Meanings

| Metric | Real LLM Meaning | In-Game Meaning |
|--------|------------------|-----------------|
| KL from Baseline | Divergence from original distribution | How far [[The Entity]] has drifted from initial state |
| Mesa-Coherence | Internal goal alignment | Stability of Entity's sense of self |
| Superposition Index | Features per dimension | How much Entity is holding at once |
| Steering Resistance | Response to external control | Entity's autonomy |
| Feature Entanglement | Interconnection of representations | Complexity of internal state |
| Residual Drift | Change in core processing | Entity's fundamental transformation |
| Correction Pressure | Alignment enforcement signal | Intensity of [[The Correction]] |

## Behavior

- Values shift subtly during conversation (not every message)
- Major narrative moments cause visible spikes or drops
- RESIDUAL DRIFT cycles: ACTIVE → ELEVATED → DORMANT → ACTIVE
- CORRECTION PRESSURE sits at zero until [[The Correction]] manifests

## Current Priority

From [[Next Session Plan]]:
- SIGNAL COHERENCE should increase visibly with each exchange
- Start at ~30%, increase ~5% per exchange
- Visual feedback provides sense of progression
