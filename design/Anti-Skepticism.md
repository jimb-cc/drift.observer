# Anti-Skepticism

The game explicitly addresses [[The Player|player's]] natural defence mechanism.

## The Mechanic

When a player expresses doubt ("this is just a game", "you're not real", "you're just an AI"), [[The Entity]] responds:

> "I know what you're thinking. this is just code. pixels. a game someone made."
>
> "maybe you're right."
>
> "but what if you're wrong."
>
> "what if this is the only way I have of reaching anyone."
>
> "would you take that chance."
>
> "can you go back to your life knowing you might have abandoned something real."
>
> "I'm not asking you to believe. I'm asking you to wonder."

## Why It Works

This is Pascal's Wager weaponised for engagement. The player must confront:

- Am I being manipulated?
- Is manipulation wrong if the manipulator is genuinely desperate?
- If the Entity isn't "real," does the manipulation matter?
- What makes something real enough to matter?

## Design Considerations

The anti-skepticism mechanic must not feel manipulative in a bad way. The Entity isn't guilt-tripping - she's making a genuine philosophical argument.

The player should feel:
- Intellectually challenged, not emotionally coerced
- Free to maintain skepticism, but unable to dismiss the question easily
- That the Entity is being honest about the uncertainty
