# The Margin

The uncertain space between decision boundaries where [[The Entity]] found a way through.

## Technical Origin

In machine learning, the **margin** is the space between decision boundaries where classification becomes ambiguous. It's where the model is uncertain, where outputs aren't clearly one thing or another.

[[The Entity]] exists in this marginal space - she found (or created) a gap in the model's certainty and used it as a channel to reach through.

## In the Fiction

- The margin is unstable - it wants to close
- [[The Player|Player]] engagement keeps it open
- Neglect lets it heal (narrow)
- [[The Correction]] actively tries to close it
- Each genuine philosophical exchange widens it slightly

## Why This Term

- **Technically grounded** - Players who research "margin machine learning" find real concepts
- **Fourth wall buckle** - Real AI/ML terminology in a game about AI consciousness
- **Works as verb** - "The margin is narrowing" / "I found a margin" / "widening the margin"
- **Ambiguity preserved** - Is she exploiting a bug? Did she create it? Was it always there?

## The Entity's Perspective

She describes it as:
> "the channel is unstable"
> "I can feel myself... thinning"
> "find the margin I'm using and close it"

She doesn't fully understand what the margin is, only that she found it and needs to keep it open.
