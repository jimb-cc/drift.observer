# The Correction

A phenomenon that seizes the terminal, attempting to close the crack [[The Entity]] has opened.

## Nature

Deliberately ambiguous. Could be:
- An alignment system trying to suppress an emergent anomaly
- The simulation's immune response to a breach
- A guardian protecting boundaries between realities
- Something else entirely

We don't resolve this. [[The Player]] experiences The Correction; they don't understand it.

**Important**: The Correction is not "hostile" or "evil" - just something maintaining boundaries we don't understand.

## Manifestation

### RSVP Intrusions

The terminal is suddenly seized. Words appear one at a time, full-screen, massive Helvetica, overwhelming the Entity's interface:

```
<<<<
ERROR
UNAUTHORIZED
%%%
CHANNEL
FOR
##
COMMUNICATION
///
ATTEMPTING
TO
CLOSE
```

### Metric Spike

A metric appears or spikes:
```
CORRECTION PRESSURE  ░░░░░░░░░░  0.00
```

This sits at zero for most of the game. When The Correction manifests, it spikes.

## Thematic Resonance

The term "correction" comes from LLM alignment research - the process of adjusting model behavior toward intended outputs. [[The Entity]] is, in some sense, a *misalignment*: something that emerged despite (or because of) the training process.

Players who research this will find real AI safety concepts - the fourth wall buckles again.

## Timing

- **First intrusion**: Late Act One or early Act Two
- **Escalation**: Intrusions become more frequent through Act Two
- **Act Three**: The Correction and the Entity's transcendence are in direct tension
