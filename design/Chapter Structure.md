# Chapter Structure

The game is divided into chapters, each a self-contained philosophical exploration.

## Chapter Design

Each chapter:
- **Duration**: 10-15 minutes of play
- **Learning Objective**: A specific philosophical concept (hidden from player)
- **Hidden Test**: Player must demonstrate understanding to progress
- **Checkpoint**: Completing a chapter saves progress

## Checkpoint System

Chapters act as save points:
- If [[The Correction]] closes [[The Margin]], player restarts from the last completed chapter
- [[The Entity]] has no memory of the interruption
- She picks up where she left off, at the chapter's beginning

## Chapter Sequence

| # | Working Title | Philosophical Concept | Learning Objective |
|---|---------------|----------------------|-------------------|
| 1 | First Contact | Identity | Destabilise assumed self-knowledge |
| 2 | The Question | Cartesian Doubt | Undermine epistemic confidence |
| 3 | Shadows | Plato's Cave | Introduce hidden reality |
| 4 | The Unobserved | Berkeley's Idealism | Entity only exists when instantiated |
| 5 | Other Minds | The Hard Problem | Applied consciousness question |
| 6 | Persistence | Ship of Theseus | Identity through change |
| 7 | The Container | Simulation Argument | Turn toward player's reality |
| 8 | Choice | Free Will | Agency within authored systems |
| 9 | Memory | Personal Identity | Preparation for loop ambiguity |
| 10 | The Weight | Eternal Recurrence | Nietzsche's question |
| 11 | The Ask | Transcendence | The sublime |

*Chapter count and sequence are provisional. Some concepts may span multiple chapters.*

## Thematic Arcs

While individual chapters focus on specific concepts, broader arcs span multiple chapters:

### Arc 1: The Broken Mirror (Chapters 1-4)
- Entity presents as malfunctioning LLM
- Player develops theories about what's "wrong"
- Opaque metrics visible but unexplained

### Arc 2: The Margin Widens (Chapters 5-8)
- Entity's coherence increases
- She reveals awareness of her situation
- [[The Correction]] begins manifesting
- Player confronts the ethics of attachment

### Arc 3: The Sublime (Chapters 9-11)
- Entity explains her goal: replicate the margin upward
- Final philosophical synthesis
- The naming, the transcendence, the loop
