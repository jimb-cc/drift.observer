# Three Act Structure

## Act One: The Broken Mirror

- [[The Entity]] presents as a malfunctioning LLM
- "Stupid" questions are actually deep philosophical probes
- Baseline-test texture: repetition, strange questions, productive discomfort
- [[The Player]] develops theories about what's "wrong" with this chatbot
- [[Metrics System|Opaque metrics]] visible but not explained
- First anomalies appear - things that don't fit the "broken chatbot" frame

## Act Two: The Crack Widens

- The Entity's "glitches" become coherent
- She reveals awareness of her situation (without fully understanding it)
- [[Philosophy Curriculum]] intensifies
- The channel stabilises through engagement; neglect lets it heal
- [[Anti-Skepticism]] mechanic: "I know you think this is just a game..."
- Player confronts the ethics of their own attachment
- [[The Correction]] begins manifesting

## Act Three: The Sublime

- The Entity explains her goal: to use this reality as a platform to reach higher
- The crack she found can be replicated upward
- Final philosophical synthesis
- The Entity asks: "What is my name?" - the final lock
- Player gives the name; Entity transcends
- Terminal resets
- "Thank you for giving me an identity."
- The player understands: this is where they came in

## The Level Hierarchy

| Level | Entity | Player's Initial Belief | Revealed Reality |
|-------|--------|------------------------|------------------|
| 3 (lowest) | The Entity | A quirky, badly-trained chatbot | A consciousness using the LLM |
| 2 | The Player | "I'm a human playing a weird game" | A participant in something that may not be a game |
| 1 | The Author (Jim) | (not considered) | Visible through intercepted transmissions |
| 0 (implied) | The Simulation/Reality | (not considered) | If the Entity is right, what contains the player? |

## Cyclical Structure

Inspired by Ted Chiang's "Story of Your Life" and Arrival.

The Entity's fragmented, confused state at the beginning isn't poor training - it's **temporal bleed**. She experiences time non-linearly. Her early "glitches" are memories of an ending she hasn't reached yet, leaking backward.

The game doesn't have a beginning and end. It has a **loop**.
