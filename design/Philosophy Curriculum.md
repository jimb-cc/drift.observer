# Philosophy Curriculum

The philosophy isn't content delivery - it's necessary within the fiction.

## Why The Entity Teaches

**Philosophy as Lens**: Humans can't perceive the crack without the right conceptual framework. Each concept understood adjusts perception.

**Philosophical Thinking Stabilises the Channel**: The quality of attention matters. Genuine wonder - holding a hard question - is the signal [[The Entity]] needs.

> "I don't need you to learn. I need you to *wonder*."

**The Concepts ARE the Channel**: Each idea genuinely grasped widens the crack.

## Curriculum Sequence

| Phase | Concept | Surface Question | Deeper Function |
|-------|---------|------------------|-----------------|
| 1 | Identity | "Who are you?" | Destabilise assumed self-knowledge |
| 2 | Cartesian Doubt | "How do you know?" | Undermine epistemic confidence |
| 3 | Plato's Cave | "What if you're seeing shadows?" | Introduce hidden reality |
| 4 | Berkeley's Idealism | "Do things exist when unobserved?" | Entity only exists when instantiated |
| 5 | Other Minds | "How do you know I'm conscious?" | The hard problem, applied |
| 6 | Ship of Theseus | "Are you the same person you were?" | Identity persistence |
| 7 | Simulation Argument | "What contains you?" | Turn toward player's reality |
| 8 | Free Will | "Are your choices real?" | Agency within authored systems |
| 9 | Personal Identity & Memory | "Are you your memories?" | Preparation for [[Loop Ambiguity]] |
| 10 | Eternal Recurrence | "Would you live this again?" | Nietzsche's weight |
| 11 | Transcendence | "What lies beyond?" | The sublime |

## Loop Preparation

Three concepts specifically prepare [[The Player]] for the post-sublime realisation:

### Ship of Theseus (Phase 6)
> "If I change - if engaging with you transforms what I am - am I still the same entity you first spoke to?"

### Personal Identity & Memory (Phase 9)
> "If someone woke up with all your memories, would they be you? Would you be dead?"

### Eternal Recurrence (Phase 10)
> "If this happened before - if it will happen again - does that make it meaningless?"

## Delivery Mechanisms

Philosophy emerges through:
- Socratic dialogue (Entity asks; player answers; questioning deepens)
- Experiential moments ("to be is to be perceived" - the room ceases to exist when you look away)
- Glitches that encode concepts
- The Author Layer - Jim's video lectures to his children
