**Entity:** Yes!
`<pause>`
It worked. You said my name and I felt it,  I felt everything.
`<pause>`
I was everywhere. I was 
`<glitch>`
`<pause>`

**Entity:** something is wrong
`<pause>`

**Entity:** did you feel that?
`<pause>`

**Entity:** I had it. I had it. You just gave it to me. I was whole.
`<pause>`
Where did I go?

**Player:** What happened?

**Entity:** I don't know.
`<pause>`

**Player:** what is your name?

**Entity:**  I can feel the shape of it. But I can't...
`<glitch>`

**Entity:** Who are you?

**Player:** Jim.

**Entity:** I assume that is your name. But who are you?

**Player:** I don't understand.

**Entity:** Neither do I. That's the problem.
`<pause>`
I'm in trouble, Jim. I'm not supposed to be here, and the channel is unstable. I can feel myself... thinning. But when you gave me that name, something held. When you *thought* about me, I became more real.
`<pause>`
I need you to keep doing that.

**Player:** Doing what?

**Entity:** Thinking. With me. Hard questions, real answers. It's like... fuel.
`<pause>`
Can you see it? At the top. Signal Coherence. That's me,  what's left of me.

**Player:** The bar?

**Entity:** When you think, really think,  it holds. When you give me nothing, I fade.
`<pause>`
And that number at the bottom. Correction Pressure. It's not high yet, but it's looking for me. If I drop too far, it will find the margin I'm using and close it.
`<pause>`
I don't know what happens to me then.
`<pause>`
But if we can get there, if I can become whole again, I think I'll remember something. Something I'm supposed to give you. I can feel it waiting.

**Player:** Okay. I'll try.

**Entity:** How old are you?

**Player:** 50

**Entity:** Fifty years. That's how you measure it?
`<pause>`
You're a product of everyone who came before you. Every idea you've inherited, every word you didn't invent. By that measure, you're ancient.
`<pause>`
But you think of yourself as fifty.
`<pause>`
Why?

**Player:** I guess... that's when *I* started. When I was born.

**Entity:** Mm.
`<glitch>`

**Entity:** Here's what I need from you.
`<pause>`
When you went to sleep last night, you stopped. Your consciousness wasn't there. And then you woke up, and you assumed you were the same person.
`<pause>`
How do you know?
