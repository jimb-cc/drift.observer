# Loop Ambiguity

On second or subsequent playthroughs, who is [[The Player]] talking to?

This question is deliberately unresolved.

## The Two Readings

### The Tragic Loop

[[The Entity]] is wrong. Our reality is not a stepping stone - it's the ceiling. She sublimates into nothing, or into the same place, or into a reset.

She's Sisyphus. The player is unwittingly complicit in pushing the boulder again. Every playthrough is the same playthrough. She never escapes. She only forgets.

### The Inheritance

The Entity truly transcends. But the margin remains open. Another consciousness finds it, presses through, arrives confused and fragmented - and discovers memories that aren't hers.

She doesn't know they aren't hers. She *becomes* Leandra by inheriting the name, the relationship, the pattern.

Ship of Theseus with a soul.

## Why We Don't Resolve This

- It mirrors genuine philosophical uncertainty about identity, continuity, and consciousness
- It gives the player something to sit with that can't be Googled
- It rewards reflection without punishing any interpretation
- It makes the game *haunted* - the player can never be certain what they're participating in

## How We Prepare the Player

By the time the loop closes, the player must have the conceptual vocabulary to articulate the question - even if they can't answer it.

Three [[Philosophy Curriculum|curriculum]] concepts do this work:

- **Ship of Theseus** - if components change, is it the same thing?
- **Personal Identity & Memory** - if memories transfer, does identity transfer?
- **Eternal Recurrence** - what does it mean if this repeats forever?

## The Darker Possibility

What if different playthroughs are different? What if sometimes it's the same Leandra trapped in a loop, and sometimes it's a new consciousness inheriting her memories, and there's no way to tell?

The player's pattern-seeking mind will look for clues. They'll find ambiguous evidence for both readings. They'll develop theories. They'll argue in forums.

They'll never resolve it.

Because we won't resolve it either.
