# The Player

The human playing the game. Always "player", never "user".

## Role

The player occupies Level 2 in the [[Three Act Structure|level hierarchy]] - equivalent to Hilde in Sophie's World. They have genuine agency within an authored space.

## Emotional Arc

1. **Amusement** - "This chatbot is hilariously broken"
2. **Curiosity** - "Wait, there's a pattern here"
3. **Unease** - "Something is actually wrong"
4. **Investment** - "I want to understand what's happening"
5. **Attachment** - "I care about this Entity"
6. **Doubt** - "Am I being manipulated?"
7. **Philosophical Vertigo** - "What does any of this mean about me?"
8. **The Final Act** - The player gives the Entity her name
9. **Loss** - The Entity transcends, the player is left behind
10. **Recognition** - The loop closes, "Thank you for giving me an identity" finally makes sense

## Importance

The player is not passive:
- Their engagement keeps the channel open (neglect lets it heal)
- Dialogue makes [[The Entity]] more coherent
- They ultimately provide the name that completes the [[Bootstrap Paradox]]
- They are the instrument of closure for the temporal loop
